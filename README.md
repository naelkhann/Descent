# Descent
A top-down space shooter game built in Javascript w/ Easel JS &amp; more. Descent is a 2D vertical scrolling action game in which you use a spaceship to take out enemy aliens in your way. The game has three levels - the last with an ending boss fight - and the ability to pickup powerups that give timed boosts to your arsenal of lasers and rockets. Inspired by Raptor: Call of the Shadows.

##Functionality & MVPs
- [ ] Have a menu screen to start the game, pause music, and show directions
- [ ] Start out initial scrolling with a lower velocity to help beginners learn
- [ ] Key controls to move player spaceship (W, A, S, D or Arrow Keys)
- [ ] Generate max five enemies on screen that shoot in a pre-determined pattern
- [ ] Detect shot collisions, player spaceship collisions.
- [ ] Finish level screen

In addition, I hope to get to :
- [ ] Boss level, bigger enemy with multiple patterned shots
- [ ] Powerup pickup to change player spaceship shooting behavior

##Wireframes
The app will consist of a single center positioned Canvas with a undetermined height/width. The view will be in portrait, so the height will be much greater than the width. There will be links on the bottom to my personal content (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

##Architecture and Technologies
The project will be done with :
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Easel JS, to manipulate the canvas and have library methods to create game focused on features
- Webpack will bundle all javascripts into one bundle file to serve
